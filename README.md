# Personality Test HTML Project

## Overview
This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS project for a personality test. It includes:
- `index.html`: Personality test page
- `result.html`: Displays the test result
- `consultation.html`: Consultation booking form

## How it works
1. Users answer three questions on the test page.
2. Clicking "See Result" calculates their personality type and shows the result page.
3. The result page displays their type and links to the consultation page.
4. The consultation page allows users to book a session.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser to start the test.

## Customization
- Edit questions/options in `index.html` as needed.
- Adjust scoring logic in `script.js`.
- Style the site via `style.css`.

This project is for demonstration and can be expanded with more questions, advanced logic, or backend integration.
